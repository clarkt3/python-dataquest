        # print(4.5 - 3.5)

#### Python Syntax

    # each print statement must go on the same line

#### Computer Programs

    # set of instructions in 'code' that the machine follows
    # a program can be complex but it can also be as simple as one line

#### Code Comments

    # comments are used to provide additional explainations w/o code running
    # exervise code:
